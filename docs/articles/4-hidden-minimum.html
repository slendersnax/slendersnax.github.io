I script them based on questionnaires which don't come from a single source - which is where my frustration comes from.

                        <p class="post-paragraph">A very important skill that I don't see discussed anywhere (maybe because I'm not looking, but regardless) is the <b>distillation of information</b>. Taking two pages of legalese and explaining it in two paragraphs instead, taking a look at the description of ten requested features for an app and realising that it's actually three features described in just as many ways (and one for the lolz).</p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">More pertinently, this is very useful for the questionnaire section above, because it can be distilled into the below:</p>

                            <li>
                                If the respondent:
                                <ul class="classic-ul">
                                    <li>saw Q4 and didn't select Code 4 they may continue and complete the Car section</li>
                                    <li>saw Q5 and didn't select Code 3 they may continue and complete the Smartphone section</li>
                                    <li>otherwise they must be screened out</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">This is also useful in general programming, though it shouldn't always be implemented like this. </p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">If, for example, you're working on a complex submission form then you have to check what's wrong rather than what's right so that you can show the user relevant feedback.</p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">If, however, you're working on some hidden function that needs to run fully only in a few specific cases, go forth and distill. :)</p>
