                            Uploaded on 2025 June 7th
                        </p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">I've been wanting to write an article with this title for a while - mostly because <i>Information Distillation</i> sounds cool, I admit. It also sounds arcane a bit, especially if you say <i>Knowledge Distillation</i> instead, like I'm an alchemist trying to create a Philosopher's Stone which will be used along with a couple of dozen brains to create the <i>Juice of Knowledge<sup>TM</sup></i>. Yum.</p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">The first part, the one that makes this sound like this article is the first in a series of articles comes from the fact that at the moment I'm part of the <b>"Professional Services"</b> division at my company. When I get to take my first look at a questionnaire, it's already been deemed <b>"Ready for Professional Services"</b> and assigned to me. So because I'm approx. five years old, I always think:
                        </p>                        

                        <p class="post-paragraph" style="font-style: italic;">
                            That is me.<br/>
                            I am Professional Services.<br/>
                            Allow me to service this questionnaire professionally.
                        </p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">Hehehe</p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">Now, this article is supposed to be about <i>Information Distillation</i> - what do I mean by that? I mean that in the above-mentioned questionnaires I sometimes encounter situations or instructions that seem a bit overcomplicated, too wordy. Some are justifiably complicated, because they're describing a complicated situation. Other times I get the feeling that multiple people worked on the same questionnaire, but not necessarily at the same time or with the same information, or with not enough time to get to know the questionnaire.</p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">To better illustrate what I mean, you can find a short excerpt from an imaginary study below.</p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">What happened in this imaginary study is that new <b>QGEN</b> options kept being added, and they kept being added to the instructions at <b>QCHILD</b> as well. You can note that the above instructions are still correct, but they can be significantly shortened if we switch to a positive affirmation:<br/>
                        <span class="pn">P.N. <strike>Don't</strike> <i>Show only</i> for QGEN option 2</span>
                        </p>

                        <p class="post-paragraph">I realise that this might seem like a <em>trivial</em> improvement to make, but I did it to make a point - it had to be obvious. I would just like it if more people took a minute or two (if possible :P) when looking over instructions in order to think a bit and ease the burden on their minds and on the minds of anyone who comes after. :)</p>
