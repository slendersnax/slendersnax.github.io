						<p>Hello, I'm Abel. Nice to meet you!</p>
						<p>I don't really know where to start, but below you can find a timeline / summary of my professional career.</p>
						<details>
							<summary>Please note...</summary>
							<p>...that I don't profess <em>extreme</em> proficiency with any of the technologies found below, at the moment I'm still trying to figure out what to specialise in. As a general rule, I prefer C++ and Python for desktop application development and Vanilla JavaScript for web development.</p>
							<p>The technologies are listed from most used to least used.</p>
						</details>
						<ul class="sl-item-list">
							<li>
								<p><b>2022 July - Present:</b> (Junior) Survey Programmer <b>@</b> Dynata.</p>
								<p><b>Technologies:</b> Decipher, Python, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, HTML5, Confluence.</p>
								<p>I'm pretty sure that survey programming is the definition of niche, but it's still pretty fun. I consider this my first real programming job - mostly because of my attitude towards it - but also because of its difficulty relative to my skillset when getting hired. For more details, see the <a href="#first">first entry</a>.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><b>2022 January, February:</b> Data Steward <b>@</b> Veeva.</p>
								<p><b>Technologies:</b> Veeva's Data Collection platform. I assume (but I never looked it up) that other companies working in the same field have similar platforms and workflows.</p>
								<p>I would rather not talk about this - it wasn't bad, but certainly not something that I would want to do for all my life (or ever again unless necessary, really). It has definitely helped me get used to working in a team, though.</p>
							</li>
							<li id="first">
								<p><b>2021 June - November:</b> Application Developer <b>@</b> Atos.</p>
								<p><b>Technologies:</b> Linux CLI, C++, Python, Bash, Confluence, Jira.</p>
								<p>The techinal interview went well, and the first couple of weeks as well. However, it became clear to me that mentally I wasn't ready for this job yet. </p>
								<details>
									<summary>Why, you ask?</summary>
									<p>Primarily because all my education and side projects (solo and in groups) didn't prepare me to:</p>
									<ul class="classic-ul">
										<li>be alright and <em>feel</em> alright with how much I don't know.</li>
										<li>ask for help (for some reason I had a subconscious expectation to do everything alone)</li>
										<li>baby steps (my manager repeatedly reassured me that he was happy with my progress, but I felt that this was completely unwarranted and that I was extremely slow)</li>
									</ul>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Story time!</summary>
									<p>Up until that point, programming meant a few files, maybe a couple of folders' worth of files linked together in a project.</p>
									<p>I remember that one of my first tasks was to track down why updating a certain package caused an error to come up during the post-installation process - but only on every second update. (an error about failing to update the sqlite database) </p>
									<p>It took me some time to recall that we had pre- and post-installation files and that I should look there instead of the source files. Upon finding where the message came from, I had to ask for some help from my manager, something which I was trying to avoid. It didn't take him too long to realise what was going on and then help me understand the problem enough that I was able to fix it.</p>
									<p>Looking back a it, this was a great learning experience. But at that moment all I could think was that I should have been able to solve that alone.</p>
