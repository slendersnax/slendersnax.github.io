							<summary>Long story short</summary>
							<p>I used a media query to check if a user <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark</code> but didn't integrate it into the pure CSS light / dark mode switcher (made using <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked#toggling_elements_with_a_hidden_checkbox">:checked</a></code> tomfoolery).</p>

							<summary>Long story long</summary>
							<p>I really wanted to implement a light / dark mode switcher with nothing but HTML and CSS, and I managed! It's not complicated, and it means the html code has a few more <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements than I initially wanted to have, but it works great.</p>
							<p>Just FYI, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked#toggling_elements_with_a_hidden_checkbox">I didn't come up with this myself</a> (also if you want you can check out the page structure with the DevTools and see if you can figure it out by yourself first).</p>
							<details>
								<summary>The Method and The Issue</summary>
								<p class="post-paragraph">I have <em>almost</em> all the contents of the page wrapped in two divs, which are needed for mobile responsiveness and dark mode. There's a <code>&lt;checkbox&gt;</code> on the same level as the first div, which means that with the <code>:checked</code> and <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator">~</a></code> selectors we can change the whole page's style based on whether the checkbox is checked or not.</p>

								<p class="post-paragraph">However, I also didn't want to blind anyone who <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark</code>, so I made a media query for that. But because the condition for this query is always <em>true</em>, it won't take into account the checkbox and stay in dark mode.</p>

								<p class="post-paragraph">There are workarounds for this, and I'm planning on implementing one of them - this sounds cool, but I unless I figure out a way to do it more elegantly I will just copy the light / dark switcher CSS into the media query.</p>
								<p>I could also (and might):</p>
								
								<ul class="classic-ul">
									<li>use JavaScript to click the checkbox if the user prefers dark mode</li>
									<li>hack around until I find a way to activate the checkbox with pure CSS as well based on a media query</li>
									<li>remove the media query - problem solved</li>
								</ul>
